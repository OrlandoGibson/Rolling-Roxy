CONTROLS
---------------------

Find the "My-Tree Gun" and use the spacebar key to fire it.

GAMEPLAY
---------------------
You start with three lives. Use them wisely.
Look out for the red-faced politicians! You'll lose a life if they run into you.
Collect recycling tokens and gain carbon credits to build your score.
Collect solar energy - the Sun - for extra life.
Cross the checkpoints to respawn later.
Avoid the surveillance cameras!
Do not get crushed by the coal industry.
Then, you'll face off with the Prime Minister.
Don't get hit by his legislation papers!

Good luck, and have fun saving the world!
