STARTING THE GAME (You might need help from an adult for this part)
---------------------
1. Extract the SaveTheWorldGame.zip folder. You should now see a normal folder with the same name.
2. Open the Google Chrome extension "Web Server for Chrome" which can be found here - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en
3. Click "Choose Folder"
4. Search through your game folders until you see a folder called "SaveTheWorldFiles"
5. Highlight/Click that folder and then click "Select Folder"
6. In your "Web Server for Chrome" window, you should see a few, funny looking numbers. The first sequence of numbers should look something like this - http://127.0.0.1:8000
7. Click that number and the server should launch the game within your Google Chrome browser window.

You're now ready to Save The World!

CONTROLS
---------------------

You play as the Planet Earth. Your aim is to beat the politicians and save yourself.
Use the arrow keys - up, down, left and right - to move around.
Find the "My-Tree Gun" and use the spacebar key to fire it.

GAMEPLAY
---------------------
You start with three lives. Use them wisely.
Look out for the red-faced politicians! You'll lose a life if they run into you.
Collect recycling tokens and gain carbon credits to build your score.
Collect solar energy - the Sun - for extra life.
Cross the checkpoints to respawn later.
Avoid the surveillance cameras!
Do not get crushed by the coal industry.
Then, you'll face off with the Prime Minister.
Don't get hit by his legislation papers!

Good luck, and have fun saving the world!
